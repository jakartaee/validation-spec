[appendix]
== Terminology

This appendix aims at giving an overview on the different key terms used through this specification. They are not to be considered formal definitions. Formal definitions are to be inferred from the core specification.

Constraint:: A restriction on a bean instance, the value of a field or the value of a JavaBean property.
Constraint declaration:: Assignment of a constraint to a target (bean, field, property) for a specific class. Typically by declaring an annotation on the target but can also be done through a XML deployment descriptor.
Validation routine:: Sequence of operations executed by the {spec-name-bv} provider to validate a given object graph.
Constraint definition:: Defines a type of constraint, its attributes and the actual constraint validation implementations. Done through annotations. The list of constraint validation implementations can be provided via XML.
Group:: Constraints can belong to one or more group or context. Useful to apply a subset of the constraints for a given use case. By default, the `Default` group is used.
Group Sequence:: Defines a group ordering in the validation process. If a given group in the sequence contains one or more failure, the following groups in the sequence must be ignored.
Constraint validation:: Constraint logic algorithm used to determine whether a given value passes a constraint or not.
Constraint validation implementation:: Class implementing the constraint logic and used to determine whether a given value passes a constraint or not.
{spec-name-bv} provider:: Product implementing this specification.
Message interpolator:: Algorithm used to build the end user message associated to a constraint failure. Typically useful for i18n.
Constraint metadata API:: API exposing the constraints applied to a given bean type. Also considered one of the integration points with other specification or frameworks.
Bootstrap API:: Bootstrapping part of the {spec-name-bv} API producing a [classname]`ValidatorFactory`.
jakarta.validation.ConstraintValidator:: Interface implemented by a constraint validation implementation.
Composing constraint:: Constraint declared on another constraint definition. When the main constraint is validated, the composing constraints are validated too.
jakarta.validation.Validator:: Main API. Holds contracts to validate object graphs.
jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolation:: Interface describing a given constraint failure on a given bean.
Getter:: Method whose:
* name starts with `get` and has a return type but no parameter
* name starts with `is`, has no parameter and is returning [classname]`boolean`
Generic type:: A class or interface with one or more type parameters, e.g. `class List<E> { ... }`
Parameterized type (instantiated type):: A type created from a generic type by providing an actual type argument per formal type parameter, e.g. `List<String>`
Type argument:: A reference type or a wildcard that is used for instantiation / invocation of a generic type or a reference type used for instantiation / invocation of a generic method. In the following example, `?` and `String` are two type arguments:
[source, JAVA]
----
List<?> list = new LinkedList<String>();
----
Type parameter:: A place holder for a type argument. Each type parameter is replaced by a type argument when a generic type or generic method is instantiated / invoked. In the following example, `E` is a type parameter:
[source, JAVA]
----
interface Comparable<E> { 
}
----
Container type:: A type of object containing one or more elements, e.g. `List`, `Map` or `Optional`
Container element type:: A type of object contained in a container, e.g. the type of the elements of a `List`, the type of the keys and values of a `Map` or the type contained in an `Optional`
