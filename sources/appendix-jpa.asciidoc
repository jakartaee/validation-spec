== Java Persistence 2.0 and schema generation

While not specified by this specification or the Java Persistence 2.0 specification, Persistence Providers are encouraged to make use of Bean Validation constraint metadata when generating DDL schemas. The proposal is as followed.

Ideas explored and not standardized

Java Persistence consumes Bean Validation (BV) metadata to enhance persistence property 
metadata.

A Persistence provider must use the BV metadata of a given list of groups. 
The default group evaluated is Default (default BV group). Groups evaluated 
can be overridden by a property. 
This property contains the comma separated groups (fully qualified class name).

For each entity, apply the following algorithm. 
For each persistent property in a given entity: 
 - extract the list of BV constraints (including the composing constraints) 
 - determine the subset of applicable constraints 
    (i.e. constraints understood by the persistence provider)
 - apply these constraints on the persistent property metadata 
 - if the property type is an embeddable object or a collection 
of embeddable objects, apply the algorithm on the embeddable object properties

The list of constraints that must be understood by persistence providers are
as followed:
 - @NotNull should be considered equivalent to @Column(nullable=false) / 
     @JoinColumn(nullable=false)
 - @Size.max should be considered equivalent to @Column.length 
     for String properties 
 - @Digits (which contains integer and fraction) should be considered 
     equivalent to @Column.precision = integer+fraction, 
     @Column.scale = fraction for decimal columns

The BV annotation metadata should have priority over JPA metadata 
(JPA has no sensible "unset" values on their annotations).

Question: should we add @Unique that would map to @Column(unique=true)? 
@Unique cannot be tested at the Java level reliably but could generate
a database unique constraint generation. @Unique is not part 
of the BV spec today.

Persistence Provider should optionally recognize and try to apply the 
following constraints as well:
 - @Min / @Max on numeric columns (TODO String too?)
 - @Future / @Past on temporal columns
 - @Size for collections and array (not sure it is feasible).

Persistence Providers can also apply non standard constraints to their metadata model. 
For example, provider ACME might recognize and understand @com.acme.validation.Email 
and apply it to the database model.

While most high level constraints will not be recognize, the BV built-in constraints 
will be the common language spoken by Persistence Providers. Any high level constraint 
can be composed of more modular constraints (constraint composition).

* additional proposal
In case of a constraint violation report detected and generated by the database 
(not null, etc), the Java persistence provider catches this report and translates 
it into a BV error report. From the perspective of the application, constraint 
errors are viewed through a unified layer. BV must provide some API to create a 
constraint violation error (constraintDescriptor.createConstraintViolation(...)).

While this proposal has a lot of value-add, I wonder how difficult it can be to 
implement this in persistence providers.

Provide a way to disable BV metadata use by a persistence provider (property based).

This is not an endorsement of the Java Persistence expert group or the Bean Validation expert group. Such approach may nor may not be standardized in the future. Such integration should not be considered portable.
